Heroine of our town, she was contemplating the sea when the Saracens attacked back in 1004. Being the only one awake, she was able to wake up all our city, which was in turn capable of defending itself from the assault. While being able to repel the attack, the siege was long and costed us many lives, including the one of poor Kinzica."
